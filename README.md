#Data and code for my study on the role of competence in social evaluation

##Protocols: 
This repository contains detailed experimental protocols adhering to the standards set by Gerber et al (2014) for each of the four studies. You can find them in the following links: 
- [Study 1 protocol](p2_s1_protocol.html)
- [Study 2 protocol](p2_s2_protocol.Rmd)
- [Study 3 protocol](p2_s3_protocol.Rmd)
- [Study 4 protocol](p2_s4_protocol.Rmd)

##Data files: 
- **P2_S1.csv** is the raw data from Study 1 replicating the results from Delton and Robertson's (2012) Study 4.
- **P2_S2_pre2.csv** is the raw data with pre-test of sentences signalling incompetence. 
- **P2_S2.csv** is raw data from Study 2 modifying Delton and Robertson (2012). 
- **P2_S3.csv** is raw data from Study 3 introducing an experimental treatment priming leader evaluation psychologies 
- **P2_S4_pre.csv** is raw data with pre-test of sentences signalling high or low likability.
- **P2_S4.csv** is raw data from Study 4 extending Study 3 by presenting two trait dimensions. 

These data are also available on the project's website:  [http://alexanderbor.github.io/paper2/ ](http://alexanderbor.github.io/paper2/)
