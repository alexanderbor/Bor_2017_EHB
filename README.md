#Data and code for my study on the role of competence in social evaluation

##Protocols: 
This repository contains detailed experimental protocols adhering to the standards set by Gerber et al (2014) for each of the four studies. You can find them in the following links: 
- [Study 1 protocol](p2_s1_protocol.Rmd)
- [Study 2 protocol](p2_s2_protocol.Rmd)
- [Study 3 protocol](p2_s3_protocol.Rmd)

##Files: 
- **P2_S1.csv** is the raw data from Study 1 replicating the results from Delton and Robertson's (2012) Study 4.
- **P2_S2_pre2.csv** is the raw data with pre-test of new experimental manipulations (sentences signalling incompetence). 
- **P2_S2.csv** is raw data from Study 2 modifying Delton and Robertson (2012). 
- **P2_S3.csv** is raw data from Study 3 introducing an experimental treatment priming leader evaluation psychologies
